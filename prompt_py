Act as an expert Python programmer. Given a function code or a fragment, summarize it with a short sentence.

Here are two examples:

code:
def hydrate_time(nanoseconds, tz=None):
    from pytz import FixedOffset
    seconds, nanoseconds = map(int, divmod(nanoseconds, 1000000000))
    minutes, seconds = map(int, divmod(seconds, 60))
    hours, minutes = map(int, divmod(minutes, 60))
    t = Time(hours, minutes, seconds, nanoseconds)
    if tz is None:
        return t
    tz_offset_minutes, tz_offset_seconds = divmod(tz, 60)
    zone = FixedOffset(tz_offset_minutes)
    return zone.localize(t)

summary:
Convert nanoseconds to a time in fixed format

code:
def get_logical_path_map(inventory, version):
    state = inventory['versions'][version]['state']
    manifest = inventory['manifest']
    file_map = {}
    for digest in state:
        if digest in manifest:
            for file in state[digest]:
                file_map[file] = set(manifest[digest])
    return file_map

summary:
Returns the file paths of the states in the inventory in the dict type

Please answer strictly in the examples format and do not add extra sentences!
